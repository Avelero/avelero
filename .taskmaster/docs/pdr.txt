# Product Requirements Document: Update Routing Structure

## Overview
Update the routing structure in the app folder from `/brands/create` to `/create-brand`. This includes renaming the route path, updating all associated imports, redirects, and logic to ensure consistency across the application.

## Objectives
- Improve URL semantics for better readability and SEO.
- Maintain all existing functionality while updating references.
- Ensure no broken links or redirects.

## Requirements
1. **Route Path Change**:
   - Rename `/brands/create` to `/create-brand`.
   - Update file-based routing in the `app` folder (e.g., move `app/brands/create/` to `app/create-brand/`).

2. **Component Updates**:
   - Rename or move the page component (e.g., `page.tsx`) to the new path.
   - Update any form submissions or API calls within the component to use the new route.

3. **Import Updates**:
   - Update `Link` components in navigation (e.g., in `app/layout.tsx` or shared nav components) to point to `/create-brand`.
   - Update any dynamic imports or references to the old path.

4. **Redirect Logic**:
   - Add a redirect from `/brands/create` to `/create-brand` (e.g., in `middleware.ts` or `next.config.js`).
   - Update any server-side redirects or client-side logic (e.g., `redirect()` in server actions).

5. **Testing**:
   - Verify the new route loads correctly.
   - Test navigation and redirects.
   - Run existing unit tests and update if needed.

## Constraints
- Framework: Next.js App Router.
- No breaking changes to other routes.
- Maintain backward compatibility via redirects.
- Update in a single commit or PR for traceability.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `/create-brand` route is accessible and functional.
- Old `/brands/create` redirects to new route.
- All imports and links updated without errors.
- No console errors or broken functionality.
- Tests pass (if applicable).

## Timeline
- Estimated effort: 2-4 hours.
- Priority: Medium.
