By 2027, every fashion product sold in the EU will carry a digital twin. Over 80% of fashion brands say they're not ready.

At Avelero, we believe this misses the point. Digital product passports aren't just a compliance burden—they're an opportunity.

### The problem with compliance-first thinking

Most conversations about product passports start and end with regulation. How do we meet the requirements? How do we avoid fines? How do we get this done as cheaply as possible?

This is the wrong framing. When you treat passports as a checkbox, you get checkbox results: a generic page that satisfies auditors and delights no one.

### Product passports are the last step in your customer journey

Think about what happens after someone buys your product. They want to know how to care for it. They need replacement laces. They're curious about your buyback program. They have a question for support. They want to verify it's authentic.

Today, each of these actions requires the customer to find your website, navigate to the right page, locate the right product, and hope they end up in the right place. Most give up.

Digital product passports change this. Every product now carries its own digital twin—a direct line between your brand and your customer, embedded at the product level. Open the care guide, and it shows instructions for *that* jacket. Contact support, and the agent already knows *which* item you're asking about. Buy replacement parts, and you get *the right ones* instantly.

This is the real opportunity: not compliance, but connection. An extension of your brand that lives with your product, wherever it goes.

### What we're building

We started Avelero because we saw fashion brands drowning in complexity. Months of implementation. Generic templates that look nothing like their brand. Manual data entry that eats up hours every week.

We're building the opposite.

First, we make setup fast. Integrations with the tools you already use. Bulk imports for your catalog. Clean product management so you're not fighting spreadsheets. Our goal is to get your passports live in days, not months.

Second, we make passports yours. Our theme editor lets you design product passports that feel like your webshop—your colors, your typography, your brand. Because a passport that looks generic undermines the premium experience you've built everywhere else.

### What's ahead

We're just getting started. The brands using Avelero today are helping us shape what product passports can become—not just for compliance, but as a genuine extension of how they connect with customers.

If you believe product passports should be more than a regulatory footnote, we'd love to talk.

Modern fashion brands use Avelero.
